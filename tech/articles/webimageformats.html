						<h3>[Article] Web Image Formats - A quick comparison of PNG, JPG, WebP, & AVIF</h3><hr>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/tech/img/articles/imageformats/formats.webp" alt="An image showcasing the logos of the 4 image formats being examined."><p>I think the AVIF logo is probably the snazziest of the bunch, while the PNG logo is probably one of the most '90s things I've seen in a while.</p>
						</div>
						<p>Simply put, this is gonna be a quick and dirty demonstration of the performance of some of the most common rasterized image formats used for storing images on the web - .png, .jpg, .webp, and .avif. Here’s a quick synopsis of each:</p>
						<p>• Portable Network Graphics (PNG) – Introduced in 1996, .png is a lossless raster image format designed to be a patent-free replacement to the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The lossless compression used means that images are preserved faithfully to the pixel at the cost of larger file sizes. Modern lossless image formats tend to be smaller owing to more sophisticated modern compression technologies, but PNG generally boasts superior compatibility due to its veterancy.</p>
						<p>• Joint Photographics Expert Group (JPG/JPEG) – The oldest image format on this list, .jpg/.jpeg is a lossy raster image format introduced in 1992 chiefly designed for storing photographic images at reasonable sizes. Unlike the other 3 image formats here, alpha channel transparency is not supported in JPG and an image featuring transparency will have it converted into whitespace upon conversion to JPG.</p>
						<p>• WebP – An image format officially released in 2018 by Google, .webp is a versatile raster image format that supports both lossy and lossless compression with far superior efficiency in file size in each compared to its predecessors.</p>
						<p>• AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) – Designed primarily for use in multimedia containers such as video, .avif is a lossy/lossless raster image format released in 2019. AVIF offers similar features to WebP as well as a superior suite of options for colour depth. Encoding images in AVIF can be more time intensive than the previous formats however, especially without a GPU which natively supports it.</p>
						<p>While .gif can be used for still images as well, it doesn’t see regular use these days for reasons of quality and performance. Even most animations these days claiming to be GIFs are actually just looping MP4/WebM video files with the playback controls hidden.</p>
						<p>My methodology is simple; I take a 759x1000 PNG image and using Paint.NET 5.0.12 I save a new version of it as each of the other file types, using the 100% quality setting for the first batch, 85% quality for the second batch, and 50% quality for the third batch. The first batch is to represent high quality image storage (demonstrating both lossless and lossy in the cases of WebP and AVIF), while the second batch is more representative of the level of compression desirable for online usage to keep file sizes lower without any serious impact to image quality. The third batch is a steep level of compression I could only imagine being used by a website churning out massive amounts of low quality content (such as a content mill or meme website) but I figured it would still be an interesting comparison. The completed charts feature all the formatted images compiled together and saved as a PNG to accurately preserve and display any artifacting present from their conversions.</p>
						<p>As a purely lossless image format, the PNG serves as an unchanging baseline to compare the others against. WebP images are saved using the ‘Default’ preset. JPG and AVIF images are both saved with 4:2:2 Chroma Subsampling for parity between the two image formats. AVIF images are saved using the ‘Medium’ encoder preset – while smaller file sizes are possible using even slower presets, I feel most users as of the time of writing probably don’t want to have to wait that much longer for their images to save.</p>
						<p>Now, let’s get to the substance of this article, the performance breakdown of each image format. I’ve prepared 3 distinctly different types of image for the test to provide a varied look at how each format deals with them.</p>
						
						<h4>Image 1 - Photograph</h4><hr>
						<p>For the first image to test, I chose a photograph of my cats Char & CC snoozing together on their bed by the back door, really showing off that I need to give the doormat a quick vacuum, but for the purposes of this test those extra gritty details are probably useful! Photographs tend to be dense with detail with constantly shifting shades and tones you won't find in many digitally created images, however a lot of those details can be smudged and compressed without any major loss to image clarity. As a format designed for use with photographs in particular, this should be the type of image JPG is most comfortable with.</p>
						<h4>100% Quality</h4>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/tech/img/articles/imageformats/Cat100Chart.png" alt="Placeholder">
						</div>
						<p>Unsurprisingly, the PNG version of this image is the largest image that will be featured in this entire article, as the original image is rich with fine detail such as the detail present on Char & CC's tortoiseshell fur and the many uneven textures present throughout, from the material of the bed to the concrete surface outside. While JPG shows a solid reduction in size compared to PNG, WebP almost matches that again for JPG and quickly shows up the older format in terms of efficiency at minimal levels of compression. Even the lossless version of the WebP conversion almost matches the lossy JPG format in terms of filesize.</p>
						
						<h4>85% Quality</h4>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/tech/img/articles/imageformats/Cat85Chart.png" alt="Placeholder">
						</div>
						<p>Once we drop the quality level below 100% however, JPG makes quite the resurgence and draws very close to the size of the WebP image while even managing to defeat the younger AVIF format in terms of file size. Perhaps if I had a GPU with a native AV1 encoder I'd be able to push the AVIF version to a smaller size than the JPG, but for now it looks like the older format can still do a decent job within its comfort zone. WebP still proves to be the best of the bunch overall however, which will become a pretty common trend throughout this article.</p>
						
						<h4>50% Quality</h4>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/tech/img/articles/imageformats/Cat50Chart.png" alt="Placeholder">
						</div>
						<p>I've gotta say, it was pretty interesting to see AVIF suddenly match JPG in terms of compression efficiency again after having lost to it by a notable margin in the 85% quality comparison. I can only speculate that perhaps JPG is superior when it comes to the initial stages of compression but AVIF's algorithms prove superior the more you try to compress it tighter and tighter. The differences in the file sizes are pretty negligible between formats at this stage, though WebP still maintains the overall lead by just over 10KB.</p>
						
						<h4>Image 2 - 2D Illustrated Style with Transparency</h4><hr>
						<p>For the next set of tests, I used NovelAI to generate an anime-style image of my character Perrine and then manually scrubbed out the background to make it transparent. The main thing I sought to examine with this test was to see if the presence of transparency had any major impact on the differences in file size efficiency between the tested images. JPG, of course, doesn't support alpha channel transparency and will instead render it as whitespace, which I figured was worth showing off for those who mightn't grasp what that entails.
						<h4>100% Quality</h4>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/tech/img/articles/imageformats/Perrine100Chart.png" alt="Placeholder">
						</div>
						<p>Moving to an image consisting heavily of flat colours with a limited palette, we see the younger formats really hit their strides. While the 100% quality lossy WebP managed to reduce the photograph of Char & CC down to a third of its size, here we see it achieve a reduction down to an eighth of the size of the original PNG. AVIF similarly sees an improvement in compression efficiency from a half on image 1 to about a third on image 2, while JPG performs about the same as it did on the prior image.</p>
