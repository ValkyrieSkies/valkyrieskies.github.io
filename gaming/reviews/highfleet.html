						<div class="imgbox">

						</div>
						<br>
						Developed by Russian independent developer Konstantin Koshutin, Highfleet is a game really quite unlike anything else. Tasking the player with leading a fleet of methane-guzzling rocket propelled airships across a hostile desert land while in the middle of a nuclear war, Highfleet is a game that combines tactical management, ship engineering, and arcade shoot-em-up combat all into an interesting blend of ordered chaos.
						<br><br>
						<hr><h3>Story</h3><hr>
						<br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/desert.webp" alt="A view of the Gerat desert with military vehicles in the background while a family in the foreground flees their home"><p>Gerat has been fighting a losing battle with the Gathering for 7 years as of the game's beginning.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/nightview.webp" alt="An officer looks solemnly into the desert after hearing the news of the imperial capital's fall"><p>The fall of the imperial capital comes as a shock to the distant fleet.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						Gerat, a sprawling desert nation inhabited primarily by the Elaim people is a land of staunch traditionalism and spiritualism. For many generations it has been a vassal to the Romani Empire, but 7 years ago war broke out across the nation as a faction known as The Gathering rose up in rebellion and sought to overthrow the Empire’s rule. Unhappy with the Elaim failing to put down the rebellion and their attacks moving out of Gerat and into the imperial heartlands, the Empire sends forth its fleet to put down the rebellion for good.
						<br><br>
						The player experiences the world through the eyes of Grand Duke Mark Sayadi Salemsky, the first son of the Emperor and a Tarkhan (military leader) of the fleet serving under Fleet Admiral Daud. Elevated to controlling the entire fleet in the wake of news of the imperial capital falling to a nuclear strike and tasked with leading a near suicidal last ditch mission to capture the capital of Gerat, Khiva, and its nuclear reactor to force the Gathering to negotiate peace, we’re given a story with strong sense of urgency which pairs well with the general momentum of gameplay.
						<br><br>
						Bolstering the story is the richly realised setting of Highfleet too – the cultural clash between the Romani people and the Elaim natives is apparent throughout the entire game, with each having vastly different cultures, philosphies, and values which often put them at odds with one another. Random events in town will often give the player further glimpses into the world, from seeing how the locals react to the arriving liberation force, resolving conflicts between clashing parties, and even to pursuing the truth behind a collection of ancient religious scripture written in a lost language which the Grand Duke can mysteriously read.
						<br><br>
						While the story isn’t the centre stage focus of the core gameplay loop itself, its more than enough to carry the campaign through to its conclusion thanks to the quality of the worldbuilding, though it probably won’t take too long for players to exhaust the pool of story events present.
						<br><br>
						<hr><h3>Gameplay</h3><hr>
						<br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/fleet.webp" alt="The fleet composition screen"><p>A wide variety of ships of different classes and roles are available to the player.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/shipbuilder.webp" alt="The ship editor"><p>A robust ship editor allows players to create and optimize their own ships.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						Highfleet is a mechanically DENSE game which will see the player die and restart over and over again, learning more and more with each passing defeat and progressing just that bit further. This section is probably going to be somewhat overlong with explanation, but I feel it necessary to convey just how much there is in Highfleet.
						<br><br>
						Every run sees the player begin by selecting the composition of their fleet from a massive variety of premade ships of various roles, functions, and sizes. The player can expand this list even further by recruiting new ships during their crusade or by using the game’s fantastically robust ship builder and creating their own tailor-made designs. I cannot stress just how good the game’s ship builder is, and I suspect a pretty significant percentage of my playtime was spent creating new designs or trying to refine a particular ship to its utmost efficiency.
						<br><br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/strategic.webp" alt="The primary strategic display interface"><p>The strategic display contains many essential tools for the player's campaign.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/nukewarning.webp" alt="Pyotr warns the player about the dangers of using nuclear weapons"><p>Nukes are an incredibly powerful tool, but they're not exclusive to the player.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						Once the player has composed their fleet, they’ll find themselves thrust unto the most important screen of all – the strategic display. Fully embracing skeuomorphic design principles, the strategic display is an immersive yet efficient display of all the most important tools the player needs as they fly across Gerat caputuring city after city, the most obvious being the central map display and the fleet management tools on the right. What really brings it all together is the electronic intelligence tools the player has access to, provided their ships have the appropriate parts equipped. Radio Intercept, Radar, Infrared Search & Track, and ELINT provide the player with a great deal of ways to detect unseen threats and out-maneuver them when used cleverly.
						<br><br>
						Direct combat isn’t the only method by which the player can confront their enemy however – from the strategic display the player can launch ballistic missiles or sortie air squadrons from the appropriate ship types. These give the player options for engaging enemies at long range, scouting out positions in advance, carrying out battles of attrition, and more. Of course, there’s always the temptation to tackle a particularly difficult object by lobbing a nuke at it, but this comes with the consequence that the enemy will also escalate to using nuclear weapons in future, so players will seriously need to weigh whether greatly increased long-term threats are worth the short-term victory.
						<br><br>
						All together, the strategic part of Highfleet is an engrossing, beautifully assembled collection of sytems that are easily the highlight of the entire game, provided you’re willing to properly engage with them of course. 
						<br><br>
						When matters move from strategic concerns to direct confrontation however, the nature of gameplay shifts entirely. Once two fleets come into contact with one another, the view changes to a 2D side-on display where players will control one of their ships at a time against up to 3 enemies at once (if the enemy fleet is larger than 3, they’ll spawn in as previous ships are destroyed) in an arcade shoot-em-up. Combat is intense and violent as each side tries to unload into each other’s weaker, unarmoured flanks and hit their most crucial systems while maneuvering rapidly to avoid incoming missiles and keeping their armour facing the enemy. Hitting fuel tanks can set ships ablaze, a destroyed ammo rack will explode and destroy surrounding parts, destroyed engines will see ships lose maneuverability and even drop out of the sky if they don’t have enough thrust, and losing the bridge is an instant kill – players are rewarded for learning particular ship classes’ weak angles and exploiting them.
						<br><br>

							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/battleplan.webp" alt="The pre-combat screen, where players choose what order their ships enter combat in"><p>Players choose what order their ships enter the battle in.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/heavycombat.webp" alt="2 cruisers engage in combat, unleashing a massive deluge of gunfire"><p>Heavy combat between cruisers is quite the explosive affair.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						While they’re given the advantage of 2 extra ships to make up for the difference in player skill vs programmed behaviour, the enemy AI isn’t without its tricks either. Heavily armoured ships will be met with the enemy firing armour piercing rounds to bypass an over-reliance on bulk, while hyper-mobile lightweight ships will spur the enemy to fire high explosive proximity fuse rounds instead to score glancing damage even if they can’t land a direct hit. Many smaller ship classes also still possess a bite even if faced down by a much larger ship – a Flower-class corvette may stand no chance against a frigate in a regular firefight, but the 8 anti-ship missiles it carries can cause a great deal of damage against even the toughest foe.
						<br><br>
						Ship combat highly rewards skilled play and it’s incredibly satisfying to overcome unfavourable odds. Battles against dangerous threats such as the roaming strike groups which roam the map hunting the player down are formidable foes and taking them down feels all the more gratifying.
						<br><br>
						Curiously though, as robust as this system is, I think it’s probably one of the main things I’d criticise – not for its execution, but rather because of how it and the strategic half of the game are essentially two entirely different games. There’s been many a time as I send various sub-fleets off to capture multiple cities at once where I wished I didn’t have to play the ensuing battles so I could continue focusing my attention on the more strategic elements of the game.
						<br><br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/city.webp" alt="The Sevastopol, docked in a city"><p>Cities allow the player to stock up on supplies and repair, amongst other things.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/landing.webp" alt="A ship lands at a very awkward angle"><p>Landing in odd ways is often the best way to maxmize your repair bonus.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						War, of course, can not happen without logistics, and Highfleet doesn’t entirely free the player from that burden. All airships require a steady supply of methane fuel, necessitating that the player purchases and refuels their airships at most of their stops and provides dedicated tankers for detachment forces comprised of vessels not designed for long distance flight. Damage taken in combat will require repairs too, and unfortunately for the player, not every city will have every part they may need. Both of these, of course, take time too, which is all the more risk of being discovered as the player waits for them to finish.
						<br><br>
						To speed up repairs though, the player can land their ships – a fun mini-game which rewards the player with even faster repair speeds if they land in tighter spaces or manage to sprawl themselves across multiple different repair zones, often in odd positions. It becomes quite a challenge if landing gears are damaged or missing entirely, and cross your fingers if you don’t have enough remaining engines to actually keep your vessel stable.
						<br><br>
						Cities offer other services to the player as well – some will contain special story events with choices the player can make that will offer rewards, punishments, and often change the people’s perception of the player. Cities are also of a specific type too – fuel depots offer cheap fuel, mercenary dens have ships for purchase, troposcatter stations let the player scan for nearby enemy ships, and so on. Most importantly, some cities will house Tarkhans – former military officers who have gone into hiding. Through a diplomacy mini-game, the player can recruit them to their cause, gaining access to particular boons associated with each Tarkhan as well as their ship.
						<br><br>
						So yeah, Highfleet has a LOT of mechanics at play – the difficulty is high, but the player is given all the tools they need to surmount it and an incredible amount of options for how they approach it. It certainly got its hooks into me after all.
						<br><br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/negotiation.webp" alt="The negotiation mini-game taking place"><p>Negotiations involve figuring out a Tarkhan's beliefs and playing to them in your speech.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/loyalistevent.webp" alt="An event shows a city leader inviting the player to their home, but only if they refuse their Elaim companions entry"><p>Events give the player chances to shape the Grand Duke's character and learn more of the world.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br><br>
						<hr><h3>Graphics</h3><hr>
						<br>
						<div class="duobox">
							<div class="duoleft"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/sevastopol.webp" alt="An artpiece depicts the Sevastopol landing as a number of officers salute"><p>The Sevastopol serves as a wonderfully grand centrepiece for the Grand Duke's campaign.</p></div>
							<div class="duoright"><img src="/gaming/img/highfleet/observation.webp" alt="An artpiece showing numerous officers cluttered around a radar"><p>Interior shots depicting cramped, mechanical interiors contrast sharply against the beautiful panoramas of Gerat.</p></div>
						</div>
						<br>
						Heavily inspired by the Soviet-Afghan war and Dune, the artwork of Highfleet is paramount in selling its world. Wide shots of sprawling desert convey just how vast the nation of Gerat is, while close-up images of crew scrambling over monitors bring us into the cramped confines of the airships. Heavy dithering, oil painting, and striking colours lend the art of Highfleet its own very unique character.
						<br><br>
						The game doesn’t relent on its artistic vision in gameplay either – the skeuomorphic GUI is highly detailed and given incredible attention to detail, ships are bustling with detail as the player can see every power generator, gun battery, radar dish, and other various parts clearly, and the map screen will even show all the individual contrails of the player’s ships when zoomed all the way in.
						<br><br>
						In combat and in towns, rainy weather will result in rain covering the screen while night drastically reduces the brightness. Gunfire in combat begets streams of tracer fire across the screen, while explosions kick up lasting clouds of smoke and rain down debris. Incoming fire will pepper the screen with bullet holes and cause the UI to violently glitch and distort momentarily. It’s hellish at times, but damn is it immersive.
						<br><br>
						<hr><h3>Audio</h3><hr>
						<br><br>
						Primarily composed of tracks by Turjan Aylahn, Highfleet’s OST is a unique mix of jaunty Arabic themed tunes, haunting hurdy-gurdy drone tracks, and light folk guitar reprieves. The most well known track of all is probably ‘Tanc a Lelek’, an appropriately dread inducing track that plays whenever a Strike Group engages one of your fleets.
						<br><br>
						Within gameplay, the soundscape is pretty decent – cannon fire has an appropriate meaty boom behind it and blasting chunks out of ships has good feedback. The voice acting for callouts and alerts is pretty flat though, and some of the electronic intelligence alerts can get quite grating over time, particularly if the radio intercept is constantly going off.
						<br><br>
						<hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><hr>
						<br><br>
						Highfleet has an incredibly steep learning curve, but once you start that climb in earnest then it’s a very rewarding experience. While it can be a bit whiplash inducing to switch between strategic play and arcade combat, both are fun systems to engage with, though in my opinion the strategic half is the more enjoyable part. I might be a little greedy in saying this, but other than that my biggest complaint is that I wish there was MORE to do in Highfleet – an alternative campaign, challenge mode, or maybe some manner of competitive multiplayer arena. Well, that’d be nice, but we simply have what we have, and what we have is pretty damn good.
