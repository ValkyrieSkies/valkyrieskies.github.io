						<p>Another year, another Steam Winter NextFest, that time of the year when Valve prods all the devs on the platform to stick out a demo and let everyone give their games a shot. I’ve always been very fond of these events as it’s a great way for indie and single/double-A developers to show off their games and drum up some attention in a much more engaging way than sticking out a trailer alone. With that all said, here’s what caught my attention this year:</p><br>
						
						<div class="highlightbox">

						<h4 id="1">Tribes 3: Rivals - Demo</h4><hr>
						<div class="imgbox">
							<img src="/gaming/img/misc/nextfest2024/tribes3title.webp" alt="An image of the title screen of Tribes 3: Rivals.">
						</div>
						<p>One of the things I’d always been sad about is that I’d missed out on the glory days of Tribes: Ascend, having never had anything more than a laptop with a pretty weak GPU for most of my teenage years. It was one of those series that was always spoken about with great fondness and a desire to see it return one day. Enter Tribes 3: Rivals, developed by former Hi-Rez subsidiary turned independent studio Prophecy Games.</p>

						<p>As I qualified above, I’m no Tribes veteran so I can’t make statements like “Tribes is back!” or “this isn’t faithful to the original Tribes experience”, but what I can say is that the Tribes 3 is fucking FUN. Skiing around the map at 200+km/h while dodging Spinfusor shots and swiping the enemy’s flag like an Eagle diving upon its prey is one of the most satisfying experiences I’ve ever had in an FPS to date. </p>

						<p>In its current state, the available games mode are Arena 4v4, wherein each time fight over a respawning neutral bomb they must slam into their opponent’s base 7 times; Capture the Flag 12v12, where players must capture the opponent’s flag while defending their own while dealing with enemy turrets and radar structures; some training modes; and custom lobbies. CTF 12v12 is the core Tribes experience so it’s what I’ve sunk the most time into, though funnily enough it doesn’t have all of its music implemented yet unlike Arena 4v4. Maybe they thought it would be a better showcase to lure in a new audience? Who knows with Alpha builds.</p>

						<p>Three weight classes with an offensive and defensive configuration each make up the game’s 6 classes (in its current implementation) and all have a distinct feel in how they race around the map, with Lightweights moving incredibly nimbly across the stage and being super maneuverable while Heavyweights prove to be more cumbersome in their movement however their high mass value allows them to build up a lot of speed very quickly when gravity takes hold of them.</p>

						<p>Each class offers a few choices of weapons and tools to add some customizability to your playstyle, from the iconic Spinfusor which rewards well-lead shots to the low damage Chaingun which is ideal for picking off agile enemies low on health to the rapid firing Grenade Launcher which can saturate an area with splash damage, most all have their use cases and are a blast to use. Classes possess unique perks too, such as Light Offence’s increased pick-up range and Heavy Defence’s increased mass value, but not all of them are particularly notable.

						<p>So yeah, it’s good! So good that instead of playing multiple demos on the first day I decided I’d write up this whole article I ended up just playing this for 5 hours straight… And then an hour more the next day. Honestly by the time I’ve actually finished this article I’ll probably have played even more…</p>

						<p>(Halfway through writing this article they updated it and changed the available game modes to 16v16 CTF and 5v5 Deathmatch as well as adding in a whole bunch of new voice over. I preferred Arena to DM, and 16v16 gets super hectic very quickly.)</p></p>

						<p>Impression: Very good! The arena shooter genre has felt quite neglected as of late so it’s great to see a legend return to rep it once more! Can’t wait to see the release version!</p>

						<h4 id="2">Children of the Sun - Demo</h4><hr>
						<div class="imgbox">

						</div>
						
						<p>It only takes a cursory glance at Children of the Sun’s grungy, psychedelic presentation and unusual twist on the premise of its gameplay to understand why it was deemed a solid fit amongst Devolver Digital’s library of games. Developed by solo developer René Rother, CotS is a dark puzzle game about defeating crowds of enemies using only a single bullet.</p>

						<p>Controlled using only the mouse, each stage starts with the player lurking around the periphery of their targets, tagging enemies and objects of interest while they look for the ideal spot to take their shot. Once the shot is taken, the player’s perspective is changed to that of the bullet. Each time the bullet takes out an enemy or strikes a target such as a car’s fuel tank, the player is given the opportunity to choose a new trajectory for the bullet, leading to the core gameplay loop of daisy chaining one kill into another. Success is achieved with the death of every enemy on the stage, while failure comes when the bullet hits anything and comes to a stop and enemies still live.</p>

						<p>It makes for a pretty solid gameplay loop, and the game ensures it stays fresh by introducing new mechanics at good intervals such as the ability to curve the bullet’s flight path or to allow the player to change the bullet’s trajectory mid-flight if they’ve hit two enemies’ glowing weakspots prior. I also appreciate that the game doesn’t feel the need to pull its punches, with some of the levels requiring a few attempts to get the full idea of exactly how to pull it off. It’s also pretty slick how the game shows you the zig-zagging path your bullet takes in the aftermath of the level before showing how you placed on a scoreboard compared to other players.</p>

						<p>If I were asked to describe what the game’s story and cutscene presentation was like, I think the words “psychotic episode” are the first things that come to mind. Cutscenes are rapid affairs of scratchy visuals and harsh noise which certainly convey a strong mood and will probably appeal to fans of similar Devolver published works like Hotline Miami, but I think I’ll pass on the style personally. Also don’t even think of going near this game if you’re epileptic.</p>

						<p>Impressions: Good, like an entire game was extrapolated out of those sequences where you guide a rocket in other games. I think playing the demo is a pretty good way of gauging if you’ll like it or not, so try it out if it sounds at all interesting to you.</p>
