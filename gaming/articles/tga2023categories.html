						<h3>Categories at TGA2023</h3><hr>
						<p>Once more we near the end of the year and less than a month away lies Geoff Keighley's Game Awards. Despite tuning in every year telling myself I'm really just watching for the announces and trailers that oft accompany the show, I've found myself engaging more with the awards part every passing year, even going so far as to make some predictions with friends about what games will win what categories (Baldur's Gate 3 is probably going to massacre a lot of the competition this year methinks). In doing this though, I've gained a bit of a bugbear about how messy some of the categories used for awards can be. So fuck it, here's my unsolicited takes on how they could be improved.</p><br>
						
						<h4>Best RPG</h4><hr>
						<p>With every passing year, the definition of an RPG grows blurrier and blurrier and the competition within this category grows denser and denser. I think it's well past the stage where this category is split up into some more specific definitions to give more games a chance to shine. For the Souls-likes and more action game inspired RPGs like Dragon's Dogma we could have <strong>Best Action RPG</strong>, while more old-school RPG genres such as CRPGs and JRPGs could have their chance to shine in <strong>Best Traditional RPG</strong> where they'd be far less likely to be overshadowed by the Action RPGs which mainstream critics tend to gravitate towards.</p><br>
						
						<h4>Best Strategy/Sim</h4><hr>
						<p>This is a strange category from the very get-go; strategy games and simulation games are a very strange duo of genres to mix together. Making things even messier is that increasingly often tactical RPGs are being submitted to this category and winning it. Well if that's how it's going to be, why not play into it then? Remove the simulation part from the category and change it to <strong>Best Strategy/Tactics</strong> instead; this gives a much more coherent vision of what kind of category of award it is without making it too narrow a category to reliably populate with nominees.</p>
						
						<p>Of course, that leaves the "sim" part an orphan. For the more literal simulator type games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator, I think they could be pretty safely merged into a category together with racing games, though that may necessitate separating sports out to avoid clutter. For the more management-focused types of game such as Cities Skylines or Stardew Valley however, they're prevalent enough at this stage to deserve their own category in my opinion; <strong>Best Management/Creative</strong> would probably do the job.</p><br>
						
						<h4>Best Action/Adventure</h4><hr>
						<p>Pretty minor one in that this is mostly a complaint about the name. I know exactly what they're trying to describe with this - it's your open-world kinda games like Far Cry or Breath of the Wild - but it seems odd to have this alongside Best Action Game. I think <strong>Best Adventure/Exploration</strong> would look a lot more natural without losing any of the scope.</p>

						<p>Aaand that's it. Pretty minor list of complaints, but it is always a shame seeing games of less mainstream genres getting totally brushed off to the wayside due to overcrowding within their category.</p>
