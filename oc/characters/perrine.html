					<h3>[Original Character] Perrine</h3><hr>
					<img class="floatleft" src="/oc/img/golarionpeenportrait.webp">
					<p>Standing at an unremarkable 5’4” in height, Perrine Novellius is a 25 year old Aphorite with a rare aptitude for the psychic arts. Possessing a head of black hair with an oddly metallic sheen, pale skin which seems to glimmer ever so slightly under the light, and the stark red eyes one might expect of someone with Infernal heritage, the woman possesses a distinctly otherworldly nature about her. Doing little to help this is her relative lack of social grace and often flat, expressionless face which makes her appear incredibly cold to the average person. Despite this however, beneath the surface is a woman driven by surprisingly intense passions and an insatiable desire to understand everything about the world around her.</p>

					<p>Born to the Molthuni locksmith Emmet Novellius and Chelish archivist Livia Faustina, Perrine’s childhood in the apartment above her father’s store, The Clockwork Lockworks, was rather uneventful until her mother passed away of a rather sudden heart attack when she was 7 years old. Though raising a child and running a business at the same time wasn’t exactly ideal, Emmet was able to manage thanks in part to Perrine being a rather quiet child who was more than happy to simply spend her time reading through her mother’s extensive library or observing her father practice his craft.</p>

					<p>It was in her adolescent years when she began trying her own hand at the family trade that she began to notice the occurrence of strange phenomena - lock pins sliding into place without her even touching them, the locations of lost objects suddenly appearing in her mind when she went to look for them, odd whispers from people that only she could seem to hear, and so on. Never one to simply accept something as it was, she began devoting her time that wasn't spent learning the family craft to researching the arcane and eventually the occult with the aim of discovering just what she was capable of.</p>
					<img class="floatright" src="/oc/img/perrine.webp">
					<p>Now in her twenties, both of Perrine's pursuits have borne fruit - years of practical experience and a natural inclination towards the structured and orderly have made her into a talented engineer already, and her studies of esoterica have granted her a solid foundational understanding of the occult art of psycana. With a modest sum of gold amassed, the Aphorite woman has decided the time has come to broaden her horizons beyond her home and discover just what mysteries lay out there in the world. Perhaps a visit to one of the Pathfinder Society's lodges could prove an enriching experience and a stepping stone towards future adventure…</p>
