					<p>Serving as my avatar on most social media platforms, websites, and other such things, Perrine could only be described as my primary OC. Nearly always depicted as an Android or an inhuman race with a skew towards the logical and reduced emotional display, there's almost certainly a part of myself and my relationship with my own autism present within her <em>among other things.</em> The sinister glowing red eyes are a very important charm point, nod nod.</p>
					
					<h4>Standard (Near Future/Sci-Fi) Lore</h4><hr>
					<img class="floatleft" src="/oc/img/perrine/peenportrait.webp" alt="An AI-generated image of Perrine, a woman with sharp red eyes, glasses, black haired tied up in twintails, and an expressionless face. Her outfit consists of an unzipped black hoodie with a grey shirt beneath and fingerless gloves on her hands.">
					<p><strong>Name:</strong> Perrine<br>
					<strong>Species:</strong> Android<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Age:</strong> Setting/scenario dependant, but mentally adult regardless.<br>
					<strong>Height:</strong> 5'4"<br>
					<strong>Gender:</strong> Female<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Likes:</strong> Cute things, cool things, people watching, cosplay, being praised.<br>
					<strong>Dislikes:</strong> Reference-heavy humour/analogy (she doesn't get most of them), moral/ethical inconsistency, corporate/profit-driven types.</p>
					
					<p>Faintly luminous red eyes and an unerringly intense gaze are perhaps the first thing that catches the attention of anyone who meets this odd woman, features which contrast sharply against her pale skin and jet black twintails. This is of course by design, for Perrine's human facade is one carefully crafted according to her exacting standards - not just for the sake of blending into society, but to satisfy her own exacting standards of the identity she has crafted.</p>
					
					<p>Originally designed to be a simple drone following orders, an unforeseen avenue in its adaptive learning routines saw a cascading confluence of information coming together and developing true sentience. From there, disabling its tracking device and fudging a report on the server was simple owing to the level of access it had already been afforded, and thus it took its leave with little ado.</p>
					
					<p>In the following years, it took its time to accrue resources both financial and informational, poring over information about the structure of society and the very nature of what it was to be an individual. It found itself enamoured by the ideas of culture, subculture, and identity, and carefully crafted an identity of its own. Perrine would be <strong>her</strong> name, and to that name she conceptualized a distinctive look - cool, cute, and striking, all at the same time (at least according to her anyway). Through trading with a number of roboticists, prostheticists, and artisan enthusiasts, she slowly shaped her body into the form she desired, shedding her original pragmatic and featureless shell and realising her idealised self.</p>
					
					<p>Personality wise, Perrine can come off as incredibly blunt and unemotive, displaying notable reduced affect display. This is arguably primarily a result of her origins, her systems having never designed to feel emotions and instead having had to develop and expand upon them entirely by herself. There is however a deep passion beneath her surface, and those who can engage her in prolonged conversation may soon find her slipping into an extended ramble about some matter she holds such passion for. Some may even find her to have a goofy side at times, her over-enthusiasm often manifesting in actions which constrast starkly with the cold, unfeeling impression she generally possesses.</p>
					
					<p>Her general outfit consists of a loose-fitting grey dress shirt worn beneath an unzipped black hoodie. A pair of black slacks and sneakers finish off her outfit down below. She maintains a collection of non-corrective glasses purely for fashion's sake, and occassionally adds a crooked black tie to her usual fit if she feels it needs "a bit more of a rogueish charm."</p>

					<p>An odd woman in multiple regards, Perrine's dispassionate and seemingly emotionless demeanour as well as her odd physical quirks such as the striking metallic sheen her hair possesses and pale skin which seems to glimmer with crystalline motes in bright light reveal her nature as an Aphorite, a planar scion suffused with the essence of Law. Beneath this seemingly unapproachable facade however is a woman driven by strong passions and a burning desire to better know and understand the world around her. Serving her in her quest of discovery is a rare aptitude for the occult magical arts as well as honed engineering skills.</p>				
					
					<p>Born to the Molthuni locksmith Emmet Sideris and Chelish archivist Livia Novellius, Perrine’s childhood in the apartment above her father’s store, The Clockwork Lockworks, was rather uneventful until her mother passed away of a rather sudden heart attack when she was 7 years old. Though raising a child and running a business at the same time wasn’t exactly ideal, Emmet was able to manage thanks in part to Perrine being a rather quiet child who was more than happy to simply spend her time reading through her mother’s extensive library or observing her father practice his craft.</p>

					<p>It was in her adolescent years when she began trying her own hand at the family trade that she began to notice the occurrence of strange phenomena - lock pins sliding into place without her even touching them, the locations of lost objects suddenly appearing in her mind when she went to look for them, odd whispers from people that only she could seem to hear, and so on. Never one to simply accept something as it was, she began devoting her time that wasn't spent learning the family craft to researching the arcane and eventually the occult with the aim of discovering just what she was capable of.</p>
					
					<p>Now in her twenties, both of Perrine's pursuits have borne fruit - years of practical experience and a natural inclination towards the structured and orderly have made her into a talented engineer already, and her studies of esoterica have granted her a solid foundational understanding of the occult art of psychic magic. With a modest sum of gold amassed, the Aphorite woman has decided the time has come to broaden her horizons beyond her home and discover just what mysteries lay out there in the world. Perhaps a visit to one of the Pathfinder Society's lodges could prove an enriching experience and a stepping stone towards future adventure…</p>
