					<hr><h3>Who are you?</h3><hr>
					<p>ValkyrieSkies, though most of my friends just call me Valk! You'll see me going by valkyrianskies on a few platforms owing to the difficulty in snagging unique usernames that aren't filled with numbers though. I'm a terminally online Irish netizen born in 1995 who's spent a more than significant amount of my life immersed in nerdy hobbies like gaming, roleplaying, enjoying anime & manga, and other such stuff. I have a habit of getting deeply invested into things that I really enjoy, and I love exploring both the technical and creative aspects involved in media. While I haven't created anything of note thus far, some day I'd like to get something out there!</p><br>
					
					<hr><h3>What's the site for?</h3><hr>
					<p>I kinda hate what the modern internet has become - so obsessed with responsive web design underpinned by complicated scripts and needless bloat. I wanted to recapture the simple, elegant design of the old internet I grew up with so I could have a place to jot down and store my thoughts and ramblings without it being lost in the unsearchable void as so often happens with older posts made on modern social media. This site requires no cookies and has no monetization in place, so it's purely a passion project of mine to put to use some skills that've sat dormant for far too long.</p><br>
					
					<hr><h3>AI Art Disclosure</h3><hr>
					<p>I often make use of NovelAI's image generation to generate images for OCs and NPCs in tabletop RPGs and similar recreational mediums. I do this purely for personal amusement and better expression of my ideas and make no claim of this involving any actual artistic talent. I do not and will not use AI image generation in any for-profit capacity. It saddens me to see that so many bad actors have immediately jumped onto such a fascinating new tool to use it for malicious, greed-driven purposes and it goes without saying that I do not condone its use for the purpose of stealing people's art styles and selling them off for a profit and other such scummy practices.</p><br>
					
					<hr><h3>What have you done?</h3><hr>
					<p>Nothing particularly notable in the grand scheme of things, but hey, I've been involved in a few online communities and their happenings!</p>
					<div class="highlightbox">
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlanetSide_2"><h4>Planetside 2</h4></a>
						<p>When Planetside 2 dropped, it seemed downright revolutionary - a massive MMOFPS featuring battles of hundreds of players across all manner of domains: infantry, vehicles, and aircraft all. I was quick to jump in and be part of it all even though my crappy little HP laptop could barely run it at the time, but hey, 20FPS was good enough for my teenage ass. For nearly a decade I continued to be part of the Planetside 2 community, playing with the oldguard clan <a href="https://ps2.fisu.pw/outfit/?name=rsg1">[RSG1] 3rd Republican Shock Guard</a> on the Terran Republic and becoming one of the clan's officers.<br><br>As I tried to open up more communication between our rather insular clan with other clans on the same faction, I'd end up networking with quite a few other clan leaders on Cobalt (the European server we played on) and got to be involved in a few community events.</p>
						<h5>Lanesmash 2021 & 2022</h5>
						<p>Lanesmash is a 24v24 community-run Planetside 2 tournament run by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ps2battles">Planetside Battles/Jaeger Events Team</a> on the private Jaeger competitive server. Receiving a prod from a fellow TR player named Edersa who was assembling a Lanesmash team ([CBT] Cobalt Terrans) and wanted to know if anyone in RSG wished to join, I ended up joining myself after not initially planing to do so. Despite not being the most skilled player (painfully mediocre honestly), I'd eventually end up becoming one of the two infantry squad leaders for the team owing to my clear communication and affable personality, and want a lark that season ended up being. We ended up coming out at the very top of our bracket, securing our place as an A-bracket team for the next season! Unfortunately however, that next season I'd end up in the middle of a rather dramatic move of house which meant I wasn't particularly capable of taking part for most of it, it was great to see CBT come 2nd place in the A-bracket, only barely losing the match at the very last minute. After that season I stepped down from the team due to a waining interest in Planetside 2 in general, but hey, it's all still good memories.</p>
						<h5>Cobalt Community Discord Server & Cobalt Clash 2022</h5>
						<p>After something happened for some reason or another, the original community Discord for the Cobalt server ended up being deleted. A new one would soon be made, and I'd end up becoming one of its moderators, once more tying me to a bunch of other community leaders within the server. From there I'd end up getting involved with the organisation and management of <a href="https://twitter.com/cobalt_clashps2">Cobalt Clash</a> 2022, a massive server-wide event which saw something to the effect of 1200 players all duke it out over the course of 2 hours to claim victory over the continent. It was a spectacular bit of fun, non-stop hectic action which was streamed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ArsheeTv">ArsheeTV</a> and saw us raising a few hundred euro for charity via <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/">Extra Life</a></p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="highlightbox">
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Station_13"><h4>Space Station 13</h4></a>
						<p>Ah, Space Station 13. What a fascinating piece of work you are. I discovered SS13 back in 2017 when I was in university and man what a time vampire that would end up becoming. I essentially played exclusively on the 4chan-based /vg/station13 server, a codebase which is often considered much more retro than other servers and arguably stayed truer to the original style of the game as opposed to more RP heavy contemporaries such as Baystation12 while avoiding becoming a no-RP deathmatch server like Hippie Station.
						<br><br>
						Over time I'd end up contributing code and mapping updates to the codebase and I'd eventually serve as an admin for some time before eventually retiring owing to a mix of both fatigue with the game after around 7 years of sticking around and my growing disenfranchisement with the state of 4chan as it devolved further and further into an echo chamber of hard-right extremists and the mentally unstable rather than the free-for-all forum of oddballs from all walks of life where everyone had an equal voice it once was.</p>
