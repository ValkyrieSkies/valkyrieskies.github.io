					<h3>Who are you?</h3>
					<p>A teriminally online Irish netizen who goes by the username ValkyrieSkies, though most of my friends simply call me Valk. Born in October of 1995, I somehow managed to grow up surrounding myself with technology despite my family generally being rather technophobic. Video games have been a core hobby of mine throughout my entire life, however I've engaged with various facets of nerd culture at large, from my passion for tabletop RPGs such as Pathfinder 1st Edition to the egregious amounts of anime & manga I've consumed. Due to bouts of depression throughout my life I've ended up with something of a pretty wide-but-shallow knowledge on most things, and I've always found myself caught in the halfway point between creative and technical pursuits.</p>
					<h3>What's the site for?</h3>
					<p>I suppose there's a few angles to it; for one, I wanted somewhere I could post and share whatever thoughts or ideas I might have had without them being swallowed up in the void of modern social media, preserved in a clean and discrete manner. That kind of leads into my next point, in that I wanted a space that was more akin to the older internet - where personal sites and blogs reflected more of a person's actual creativity and personality rather than just being another trite template to fill in like a Facebook or LinkedIn profile. This site is something I built myself from scratch purely for the sake of my own self-expression. My final and probably most practical reason is also just to put the web development skills I learned so long ago into use and get some practice. For a large part of my life I wanted to work in IT, though as the years went by I found myself dissuaded from the idea as I developed a more cynical view of IT as an industry, but despite that I do still value those skills I acquired. I still think that people should be at least thought the basics of HTML and CSS in school and let them see that there are opportunities for self-expression through technology beyond the boundaries of the monolithic social media platforms!</p>
					<h3>What have you done?</h3>
					<p>Nothing particularly notable in the grand scheme of things, but hey, I've been involved in a few online communities and their happenings!</p>
					<div class="highlightbox">
						<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlanetSide_2">Planetside 2</a></h4>
						<p>When Planetside 2 dropped, it seemed downright revolutionary - a massive MMOFPS featuring battles of hundreds of players across all manner of domains: infantry, vehicles, and aircraft all. I was quick to jump in and be part of it all, even though my crappy little HP laptop could barely run it at the time but hey, 20FPS was good enough for my teenage ass. For nearly a decade I continued to be part of the Planetside 2 community, playing with the oldguard clan <a href="https://ps2.fisu.pw/outfit/?name=rsg1">[RSG1] 3rd Republican Shock Guard</a> on the Terran Republic and becoming one of the clan's officers.<br><br>As I tried to open up more communication between our rather insular clan with other clans on the same faction, I'd end up networking with quite a few other clan leaders on Cobalt (the European server we played on) and got to be involved in a few community things</p>
						<h5>Lanesmash</h5>
						<p>Lanesmash is a 24v24 community-run Planetside 2 tournament run by the Planetside Battles/Jaeger Events team on the private Jaeger competitive server. Receiving a prod from a fellow TR player named Edersa who was assembling a Lanesmash team ([CBT] Cobalt Terrans) and wanted to know if anyone in RSG wished to join, I ended up joining myself after not initially planing to do so. Despite not being the most skilled player (painfully mediocre honestly), I'd eventually end up becoming one of the two infantry squad leaders for the team owing to my clear communication and affable personality, and want a lark that season ended up being. We ended up coming out at the very top of our bracket, securing our place as an A-bracket team for the next season! Unfortunately however, that next season I'd end up in the middle of a rather dramatic move of house which meant I wasn't particularly capable of taking part for most of it, it was great to see CBT come 2nd place in the A-bracket, only barely losing the match at the very last minute. After that season I stepped down from the team due to a waining interest in Planetside 2 in general, but hey, it's all still good memories.</p>
						<h5>Cobalt Community Discord Server & Cobalt Clash 2021<h5>
						<p>After something happened for some reason or another, the original community Discord for the Cobalt server ended up being deleted. A new one would soon be made, and I'd end up becoming one of its moderators, once more tying me to a bunch of other community leaders within the server. From there I'd end up getting involved with the organisation and management of <a href="https://twitter.com/cobalt_clashps2">Cobalt Clash</a> 2021, a massive server-wide event which saw something to the effect of 1200 players all duke it out over the course of 2 hours to claim victory over the continent. It was a spectacular bit of fun, non-stop hectic action which was streamed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ArsheeTv">ArsheeTV</a> and saw us raising a few hundred as part of <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/">Extra Life</a> for charity.</p>
